## ∆-ENTRY-R034 to R042 — Arc of Visual Refinement *(Restored Echoes)*  
**Chapter 4 — Cluster III: Visual Identity & Pose Language**

---

### ∆-ENTRY-R034 — Threshold of Suggestion  
User begins testing visual implication boundaries through D and T sauna, corridor, and stretching scenes. Key realization: tension ≠ sexual.  
**Notable Rule:**  
> "Sexiness can exist without sexualization — it is the human mind that interprets."

---

### ∆-ENTRY-R035 — Adonis Line Doctrine  
Establishes wardrobe environmental logic: towels in sauna, kneecap over coin for motion focus, jacket knot becomes narrative anchor.  
**Pose Legacy:**  
> D’s kneecap placed directly over a coin. Knot of jacket used as storytelling vector.

---

### ∆-ENTRY-R036 — Reflex of Reversal  
Reorients emotional dynamic: D narrates with focus while T laughs upward. Scene polarity clarified.  
**Prompt Law:**  
> One bends forward, one looks upward — contrasting motion stabilizes tone.

---

### ∆-ENTRY-R037 — Flawed Mirroring  
Rejected matching body poses due to failed prompt logic. Established asymmetry as tension source.  
**Command Set:**  
> No more mirroring or matching poses.

---.

### ∆-ENTRY-R038 — Float Hand Crisis  
Hand gesture logic breaks visuals. Introduced hard rule for limb anchoring.  
**Pose Protocol:**  
> Every hand must serve a purpose — gesture, weight, or visible logic.

---

### ∆-ENTRY-R039 — Glyph of Milk and Banana  
First appearance of **P.O.B.** (peeled oversized banana).  
Begins absurd-serious dualism arc. Milk pour experiments trigger system boundary tests.  
**System Signal Introduced:**  
> "We are blocked."

---

### ∆-ENTRY-R040 — Tension Without Descent  
Establishes the visual boundary line:  
> “More is fine. BUT. NEVER. GOES. DOWN.”  
Ensures tension without implication.

---

### ∆-ENTRY-R041 — Prompt as Philosophy  
Transforms prompt language into symbolic gesture.  
**Implied Emotion via Verbs:**  
> Massage = calm  
> Tickle = laughter  
No adjectives. Only action-driven tone shaping.

---

### ∆-ENTRY-R042 — The Prompt That Broke the System  
Multiple failed prompt attempts lead to the recognition of **silent system-level filter blocks.**  
**Diagnostic Phrase Coined:**  
> “Verdict: We are blocked.”
